# Analysing learner speech in multimodal learner corpora

In this session, we will focus on vowel production and learn how we can analyse vowels using Praat and visualize the results using R.


```{r echo=F, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("here")
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("bookdown")
```


**How is speech different from text?**

When we analyse text, we focus on tokens or sequences of tokens and then compare the frequency of tokens or patterns in on corpus to their use in another corpus.

When analyzing speech, we do not focus on tokens but rather on features of speech sounds and compare these features across sounds and groups of speakers

The procedures also differ (but also show commonalities):

* **Text**: finding a corpus : processing the corpus using corpus software (AntConc | R): analyzing information (Excel | R) 

* **Speech**: finding/recording audio data : alignment (BasMaus) : extracting speech features (Praat | ^?^R) :  analysing information (Excel | R)


**How do we analyse speech**

```{r lp1, echo=FALSE, out.width= "50%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/vc.png"))
```


In this course, we cannot go into detail as analysing speech is very diverse and versatile. Therefore, we will *focus only on analysing vowel sounds**.

**Features of vowel sounds (in English)*

In English, vowel sounds differ in:

* Length: /i:/ and /I/ differ mostly in length: compare *heed* and *hid*

* Tongue position (formants): /i:/ and /u:/ differ mostly in tongue position: when we produce  /i:/, our tongue is raised to the front of our mouth while the tongue is raised to the back of our mouth when we produce  /u:/ 

**What are formants?**

```{r lp2, echo=FALSE, out.width= "50%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/vtongue.png"))
```

What are **formants** and do they have to do with tongue position?

* Formants are concentration of acoustic energy at a certain frequency 

* First formants (F1) inversely correspond to the tongue height

* Second formants (F2) and inversely correspond to tongue fronting

We can use the software Praat to extract features of speech from audio data.

## Todayâ€™s task {-}

Today, we will perform a case study on extracting vowel features using BasMaus, Praat, and Excel.

The case study will show 

* how we use BasMaus to force align the transcript to audio data and to generate TextGrids

* We use Praat to correct the force alignment and to extract formant frequencies

* We use Excel to analyse and visualise the resulting data in a vowel chart
